## 💻 Usage

Create a configuration file:

```json
{
	"server": {
		"execPath": "your/path/to/chrome.exe"
	},
	"panel": {
		"bots": [
			{
				"name": "example1",
				"displayName": "Example room 1",
				"path": "path/to/example1.js"
			},
			{
				"name": "example2",
				"displayName": "Example room 2",
				"path": "path/to/example2.js"
			}
		],
		"discordToken": "a discord bot token",
		"clientId": "your bot's user id",
		"channels": ["list", "of", "channels", "where", "commands", "can", "be", "used"]
	}
}
```

Put the module in your directory and open the server with a simple command:

```bash
node haxball-server open -f config.json
```

Using Linux? Lacking a UI?
Connect to the server remotely using (AWS example):

```bash
haxball-server connect --host "ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com" --user "ubuntu" --privateKey "path/to/keys.pem"
```

You must open and close rooms directly on Discord using the bot whose token is being used in the config file.
Use `!help` (or the prefix you assigned) to see the server commands.

## 🏡 Remote debugging

Haxball Server allows you to remotely access Chrome Dev Tools for all of your rooms by means of a SSH tunnel. All you have to do is to run a single command.

Once the connection is established you'll be able to access the Dev Tools feature in [http://localhost:9601](http://localhost:9500).

### 🔐 Connect using a password

```bash
haxball-server connect --host "myhost.com" --user "myuser" --password "mypassword"
```

### 🔑 Connect using a private key

```bash
haxball-server connect --host "myhost.com" --user "myuser" --privateKey "path/to/keys.pem"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 💾 server

#### proxyEnabled?: boolean

Whether to use proxies or not. Haxball only allows 2 rooms per IP so if you want to open more than 2 rooms you'll have to create multiple IPs and assign them to a proxy server.

#### proxyServers?: string[]

The proxy IP addresses. This is required if you enable proxies. Example:

```js
"proxyServers": ["127.0.0.1:8000", "127.0.0.1:8001"]
```

#### userDataDir?: string

[Chrome user data dir path](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/user_data_dir.md). Only works if cache is not disabled.

#### disableCache?: boolean

Disable all caching. Rooms will be started in incognito mode. This is highly recommended if you're not using localStorage or IndexedDB (and you shouldn't).

#### disableRemote?: boolean

Disable remote debugging. The server won't listen for connections.

#### disableAnonymizeLocalIps?: boolean

Adds the `--disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns` flag to Chrome. [See more here](https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Headless-Host#connectivity-warning).

#### maxMemoryUsage?: number

Set the limit for Javascript memory usage. Max value of 1024 (1 GB) in 32-bit systems and 4096 (4 GB) in 64-bit systems.

#### execPath: string

The path to Chrome (or Chromium) executable file. If you are on Windows this will probably be `C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe`.

On Ubuntu you can install Chromium using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
```

And `execPath` will be:

```js
"execPath": "/usr/bin/chromium-browser"
```

### 🖥️ panel

#### bots: { [name: string]: string } | { name: string, path: string, displayName?: string }[]

The list of bots and the path to their JS file.

##### Example (as an array - recommended):

```js
"bots": [
    { "name": "classic", "displayName": "Classic room", "path": "./bots/classic.js" },
    { "name": "futsal", "displayName": "Futsal room", "path": "./bots/futsal.js" }
]
```

##### Example (as an object, does not support `displayName`):

```js
"bots": {
    "classic": "./bots/classic.js",
    "futsal": "./bots/futsal.js"
}
```

#### discordToken: string

The token of your Discord bot.

#### discordPrefix: string

The prefix for the bot commands.

#### mastersDiscordId: string[]

The players allowed to use the bot. Nobody but the users listed here will be able to run commands.

#### customSettings?: CustomSettingsList

See [custom settings](#-custom-settings).

#### maxRooms?: number

The maximum number of rooms. This is useful if you want more control over the server.

## 🔧 Custom settings

Let's say you want to open 2 rooms. Both are futsal rooms, but one is 3v3 and the other is 4v4. Instead of creating two different bot files, 3v3.js and 4v4.js, you can use the `panel.customSettings` config to pass custom parameters to the bot script.

Not only you can pass custom parameters but you can also customize the `HBInit` options.

For example:

```json
"customSettings": {
    "3v3": {
        "reserved.haxball.roomName": "Futsal 3v3",
        "gameMode": 3
    },
    "4v4": {
        "reserved.haxball.roomName": "Futsal 4v4",
        "gameMode": 4
    }
}
```

Bots loaded with the `3v3` settings will be named `Futsal 3v3`. The same applies to `4v4`. The `gameMode` setting will be available in `window.CustomSettings.gameMode`.

Custom settings also support inheritance and multiple inheritance. Suppose you want to define your room geolocation using custom settings as well as create a private room for your league:

```json
"customSettings": {
    "new-york": {
        "reserved.haxball.geo": {
            "code": "us",
            "lat": 40.730,
            "lon": -73.935
        }
    },
    "competitive": {
    	"reserved.haxball.password": "12345"
    },
    "3v3": {
        "extends": "new-york",
        "reserved.haxball.roomName": "Futsal 3v3",
        "gameMode": 3
    },
    "4v4": {
        "extends": "new-york",
        "reserved.haxball.roomName": "Futsal 4v4",
        "gameMode": 4
    },
    "3v3-league": {
        "extends": ["competitive", "3v3"],
        "reserved.haxball.roomName": "Futsal 3v3 League"
    }
}
```

With this configuration you'd open your public rooms with the `3v3` and `4v4` settings, and when there's a match in your league, you'd open a room with the `3v3-league` setting. All using the same `futsal.js` bot!

For instance, on Discord you would open the `3v3` room like this: `!open futsal thr1.AAAAAGEdKD4xW3bEOZDBBA.ZCzb426KBF4 3v3`

You can also create `default` custom settings. This way, every room you open without specifying custom settings will automatically be assigned the `default` settings. For example, if you want to make private every room that have been opened without specifying custom settings:

```json
"customSettings": {
    "default": {
        "reserved.haxball.public": false
    }
}
```

## 📡 Using proxies

If you are hosting your Haxball server on AWS EC2, you can use the proxy feature (and therefore open more than 2 full functional rooms) by assigning an [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html#StepThreeEIP) to a [secondary IPv4 private address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html#assignIP-existing).

Enabling the new secondary IP depends on which service you're using. This will work for Ubuntu 20.04 running on the T4G family (`t4g-small` is the best one). [And according to the official documentation, Amazon Linux will automatically assign it for you](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html#StepTwoConfigOS). If you're not using Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 20.04 with the T4G family, you'll have to look it up yourself; however, the steps will likely be similar to the steps below.

After assigning them, you can enable the new secondary IP using (you'll have to repeat this step every time you restart the instance):

```bash
sudo ip addr add xx.xx.xx.xx/20 dev ens5 label ens5:1
```

Where xx.xx.xx.xx is the new secondary IP.

To add a proxy to the new secondary IP, install Squid:

```bash
sudo apt-get install squid
```

Open the `squid.conf` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf
```

Then add these lines to the file:

```txt
http_port 127.0.0.1:8000 name=8000
http_port 127.0.0.1:8001 name=8001

acl prt8000 myportname 8000 src xx.xx.xx.xx/24
http_access allow prt8000
tcp_outgoing_address xx.xx.xx.xx prt8000

acl prt8001 myportname 8001 src yy.yy.yy.yy/24
http_access allow prt8001
tcp_outgoing_address yy.yy.yy.yy prt8001
```

Where xx.xx.xx.xx is your main private IP and yy.yy.yy.yy is the secondary one. If you want more than 2 proxies (more than 4 rooms), just add new configurations until you're done:

```txt
http_port 127.0.0.1:8002 name=8002

acl prt8002 myportname 8002 src zz.zz.zz.zz/24
http_access allow prt8002
tcp_outgoing_address zz.zz.zz.zz prt8002
```

And then restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart squid
```

Now you'll be able to use the proxy feature by simply enabling the `server.proxyEnabled` config and adding your proxy IPs to `server.proxyServers`.

Example:

```json
"server": {
    "execPath": "/usr/bin/chromium-browser",
    "proxyEnabled": true,
    "proxyServers": ["127.0.0.1:8000", "127.0.0.1:8001"]
}
```
